<p>论坛里牛人多，xhy就是一个。在一次论战中（http://forum.ubuntu.org.cn/viewtopic.php?f=105&amp;t=176262&amp;start=15），他说道：
<blockquote>Linux is for people who want to know why it works.<br />
Mac is for people who don't want to know why it works.<br />
DOS is for people who want to know why it does not work.<br />
Windows is for people who don't want to know why it does not work.</blockquote>
实在是高啊。</p>
